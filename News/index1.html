    <h1><u> RIPTILE'S WEEKLY DIGEST </u></h1>
   <p> A Beautiful morning to all my readers who have been waiting for me all this time.
    I am so happy to be back. I had to take a break and lie low for a while because a 
lot of you have been digging into finding out about who i really am and as i always say, this 
venture is only a mere waste of time. Well then, let's begin.
I have three topics to write about today.
</p>
  <h3><u>KYLIAN MBAPPE'S TRANSFER</u></h3>
   <p> Kylian Mbappe is 'super excited' for what the future holds as he announces his exit from
    PSG. The french forward has sealed his transfer to Real Madrid, a dream come true for the young player. 
    So a big congratulations to all fans as we expect and pray for a win at the next champions league tournament 
    for our guy. We can only hope for the best.</p>

     So we move on to our next topic which is the release of the Bridgerton series!!!
     I am a huge fan of the franchise.<h3>
        <u>BRIDGERTON SEASON III RELEASE DATE</u>
    </h3>This season about Collin and Penelope has brought so much joy to
    the faces of their viewers. I cannot wait for Benedict's story personally. He is one of my favourite 
characters and i would love to know how he blossomed. Luke Thompson really embodied tha character, his playful 
demeanor is my most admired trait of his. <br>

    <h2><u>NVIDIA'S TECH UPDATES</u></h2>
    <h5>Nvidia’s 10-for-1 stock split is in effect, giving investors nine additional shares for every one that they already own.
Shares declined slightly to $119.77 shortly after the market open on Monday.
Nvidia’s stock price has more than doubled this year after more than tripling in 2023 and it’s now the third most valuable company in the S&P 500. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to briefly surpass Apple last week as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market value.
The chipmaker has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications. The company’s revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier.
Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here’s a look:
</h5>
<p>Here's a list of upcoming features of Nvidia:
    <ol>
        <li>RTX 50 series, codenamed Blackwell, is slated for a late 2024 to early 2025</li>
        <li>Senior Contributor. Nvidia is likely aiming for a late 2024 release of its next generation RTX 5000 'Blackwell' gaming graphics cards,
         specifically the GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080.</li>
        <li>Nothing is as breathtaking as playing your favorite games across three monitors. At 5760 x 1080, the expanded field of view fully engages human peripheral vision and provides for the most immersive experience in racing and flight simulators. 
        Add in a fourth display to keep tabs on chat, email or web while you are gaming.</li>
